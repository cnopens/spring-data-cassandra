The Apache Cassandra NoSQL Database offers many new capabilities for teams seeking a solution to handle high velocity, high volume and variable data flows. This new way of thinking introduces new concepts and a learning curve that can be intimidating to team members and team managers. Spring Data Cassandra offers a familiar interface to those who have used other Spring Data modules in the past.

* Build repositories based on common Spring Data interfaces
* Support for synchronous and asynchronous data operations
* Asynchronous callback support
* Support for XML based Keyspace creation and CQL Table creation
* JavaConfig and XML Support for all Cluster and Session Capabilities
* Exception Translation to the familiar Spring DataAccessException hierarchy
* Convenient QueryBuilders to eliminate the need to learn CQL
* Based on the latest DataStax Enterprise CQL Java Driver
